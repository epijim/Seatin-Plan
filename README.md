Seating-Plan algo for Jesus College MCR superhalls
===========

## Current use (while shiny being set up)

### Step 1

1. Once all the tickets have been sold
2. There is an excel file in this repo that will take the list and seperate out guests ready for the form
3. Then put it all into a form and release. **It's important to make sure that guests are seperate entries, and that the max number of options people can select is 8**

### Step 2

4. Once the form closes, run the script on a csv of the form responses and the original list uploaded to the form.
    5. Both list are required as the script will make sure people not in a table are still seated in hall.    
5. Done.
